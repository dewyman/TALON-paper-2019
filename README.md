# TALON paper repository
This repository contains custom scripts and documentation associated with the analyses in our BioRxiv manuscript concerning the application of our TALON pipeline to long read transcriptomes from PacBio and direct-RNA Oxford Nanopore. 

You can find the preprint here: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/672931v1

[refs](https://github.com/dewyman/TALON-paper-2019/tree/master/refs):
Contains instructions for downloading reference genomes, GENCODE annotations, and variant files. Also includes scripts we used to prepare input files for TranscriptClean and TALON initializations.

[Illumina](https://github.com/dewyman/TALON-paper-2019/tree/master/Illumina):
Scripts for downloading short-read Illumina RNA-seq data from the ENCODE consortium and running Kallisto on them in order to perform short read quantification.

[analysis_scripts](https://github.com/dewyman/TALON-paper-2019/tree/master/analysis_scripts):
Older versions of visualization scripts for plotting things like gene/transcript expression correlations etc. We are in the process of deprecating this directory and moving final script versions to plotting_scripts instead.
