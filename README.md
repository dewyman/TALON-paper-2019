# TALON-paper-2019
Contains reference files and scripts for the analyses in the TALON paper

## Reference files
Reference files such as GTFs should be placed in the 'refs' directory. If a file exceeds the 100MB size limit imposed by Git, then include instructions on how to obtain that file rather than adding the file itself.
