# Genomic transcripts
The goal here is to characterize the properties of the 'genomic' transcript category.

See the [last_exons](https://github.com/dewyman/TALON-paper-2019/tree/master/genomic_transcripts/last_exons) dir for instructions to find out how many genomic transcripts overlap with the last exon of a transcript in various datasets.
